make: *** [lbfgs.o] Error 4

Need to change the hardcoded path /usr0/home/wammar/git/liblbfgs/lib/lbfgs.c in the path

-- Downloaded lbfgs and modified the makefile to point to the newpath - Working

--------------------------------------------

Got error with Eigen/Dense
#include <Eigen/Dense>
                       ^
compilation terminated.
make: *** [LatentCrfParser.o] Error 1

Solution
Apparently this library was changed to eigen3 sometime back. So setting up a soft link to that - didn't solve 

FIX
====
installed libeigen3-dev
and modified the imports in parsing/LatentCrfParser.h - changed #include <Eigen/Dense> to <eigen3/Eigen/Dense>


---------------------------------

./train-latentCrfPosTagger 
./train-latentCrfPosTagger: error while loading shared libraries: libfst.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Solution
Sounds like the loader isn't looking for libraries in /usr/local/lib. 
Add that directory to your loader config in /etc/ld.so.conf* and run ldconfig.

-------------------------------

libraries not found
tried to put all the header files in core and wammar-utils inside the main directory

-----------------------------
train-hmmPosTagger.cc:23:3: error: reference to ‘mpi’ is ambiguous

FIXED
======
Made the following changes to train-hmmPosTagger
- removed using namespace boost
	- replaced it with 
namespace mpi = boost :: mpi;
- Added the following 2 header files
#include <boost/mpi/environment.hpp>
#include <boost/mpi/communicator.hpp>


-------------------------------

Compilation status 1/31 morning
================================
Makefile-hmmAligner -- getting unknown error
Makefile-hmmPosTagger  -- Error with ambiguity in MPI - fixed, now getting error with LearningInfo
Makefile-latentCrfAligner - SUCCESS
Makefile-latenCrfParser - Fixed Eigen/Dense Error, now getting Error with ambiguity in MPI
Makefile-latentCrfPosTagger - SUCCESS
Makefile-model1 -- Error in StringUtils.h
Makefile-reorderingSemiring - unknown error


Update 02/07/2016
------------------

- Looks like Makefile-latentCrfParser is still in the works. I am going to abandon attempts to fix it
- Makefile-latentCrfPosTagger works - experiment1
- The readme file gives an example of how to run the experiments
	- Basically we need only two things
		- A text file with one sentence per line
		- A text file containing word level features 
			- Investigate the paper on what features they have used 
- We have to try to look at the script to see what they have used to come up with features ( word level features)
